The 'file dataset-TCs.mat' contains a total of 18 data matrices corresponding to the core experimental datasets used in this study.
The variables ‘EX’ and ‘EM’ represent the excitation and emission wavelength ranges, respectively.
‘Blank_01’, ‘Blank_02’, and ‘Blank_03’ correspond to blank background measurements.
‘C01’–‘C07’ represent the calibration set samples.
‘P00_01’, ‘P00_02’, and ‘P00_03’ correspond to real (unspiked) samples.
‘P01’, ‘P02’, and ‘P03’ correspond to spiked samples used as the prediction set.
All datasets were collected under the same experimental conditions as described in the Materials and Methods section and were used for EEM data analysis and PARAFACM modeling in this work.
